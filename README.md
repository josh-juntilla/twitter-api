# twitter-api

This is a very simple REST API hello world and a demo of the Twitter API search. I use CodeIgniter 3 framework around it with a simple PHP based User Registration system. It has a working Registration, Email verification, Reset password and Login. It uses PHPMailer for email sending. Bootstrap was used for the design.

Make sure to import the database (user-registration.sql) so the registration system will work.

In case the email sending is not working on your end, you may just manually update the user credentials directly in the database.. but I'm pretty sure it will work as long as you have internet connection.
